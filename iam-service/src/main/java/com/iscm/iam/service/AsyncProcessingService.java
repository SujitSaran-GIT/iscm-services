/**
 * TEMPORARILY DISABLED - All async processing functionality has been disabled for simplification.
 *
 * This service has been temporarily disabled to remove advanced implementations including:
 * - Async processing with @Async annotations
 * - Background task execution
 * - Batch processing operations
 * - Scheduled async operations
 *
 * To re-enable this service:
 * 1. Uncomment and restore the original implementation
 * 2. Ensure AsyncConfig.java is properly configured with @EnableAsync
 * 3. Verify that thread pool beans are defined
 * 4. Update application.properties with async configuration
 *
 * This is part of simplification efforts to remove:
 * - Redis dependencies
 * - Rate limiting
 * - Advanced async processing
 * - Kafka messaging (if implemented)
 * - Complex caching strategies
